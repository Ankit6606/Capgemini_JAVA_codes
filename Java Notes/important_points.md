
## Early vs Lazy Instantiation

### Difference Between Early and Lazy Instantiation

#### Early Instantiation (Eager Instantiation)

- **Definition**: Object is created when the class is loaded.
- **When It Happens**: Immediately during class loading.
- **Memory Usage**: Higher, since the object is created whether used or not.
- **Performance**: Fast access as the object is already created.
- **Use Case**: When the object is lightweight and frequently used.

**Example (Java)**:
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton(); // early instantiation

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Lazy Instantiation (Lazy Loading)

- **Definition**: Object is created only when needed.
- **When It Happens**: Upon first access.
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient, object created only if required.
- **Performance**: Slightly slower on first access due to initialization.
- **Use Case**: For heavy or rarely used objects.

**Example (Java)**:
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance; // not created yet

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(); // lazy instantiation
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Summary Table

| Feature               | Early Instantiation     | Lazy Instantiation        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Object Creation Time  | At class loading        | When first accessed        |
| Memory Usage          | Higher                  | More efficient             |
| First Access Speed    | Faster                  | Slightly slower            |
| Suitable For          | Frequently used objects | Rarely used/heavy objects  |

## What is Polymorphism?

- **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It supports "many forms" via a shared interface.

### Types of Polymorphism

#### 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static)

- Achieved by method overloading.
- Resolved at compile time.

**Example**:
```java
class Math {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic)

- Achieved by method overriding.
- Resolved at runtime.

**Example**:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Code reusability
- Flexibility and maintainability
- Clean and extensible code

## Difference Between `throw` and `throws` in Java

### üîπ `throw`

- **Purpose**: Manually throw an exception.
- **Used In**: Method or block.
- **Follows**: An instance of `Throwable`.

**Example**:
```java
public void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote");
    }
}
```

### üîπ `throws`

- **Purpose**: Declares possible exceptions a method may throw.
- **Used In**: Method signature.
- **Follows**: Exception class names.

**Example**:
```java
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    // code that might throw IOException
}
```

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table

| Feature      | `throw`                         | `throws`                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Definition   | Used to throw an exception       | Declares exceptions in method     |
| Location     | Inside a method or block         | In method signature               |
| Purpose      | Instantly trigger an exception   | Inform caller about possible exceptions |
| Follows      | Throwable instance               | Exception class name(s)           |
| Example      | `throw new IOException();`       | `throws IOException, SQLException`|

**Example using both**:
```java
public void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
    FileReader file = new FileReader(fileName);
    if (file == null) {
        throw new IOException("File not found");
    }
}
```

## Compare `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` in Java

### üîπ `final`

- **Purpose**: Prevents modification.
- **Used With**:
  - Variable ‚Üí constant
  - Method ‚Üí cannot be overridden
  - Class ‚Üí cannot be subclassed

**Example**:
```java
final int MAX = 100;
final void display() {}
final class Vehicle {}
```

### üîπ `finally`

- **Purpose**: Code that always runs after try/catch (e.g. cleanup).
- **Usage**: In try-catch-finally block.

**Example**:
```java
try {
    int data = 50 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception caught");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Finally block always runs");
}
```

### üîπ `finalize()` (Deprecated)

- **Purpose**: Cleanup before garbage collection.
- **Usage**: Called by GC before object destruction.

**Example**:
```java
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    System.out.println("Object is being garbage collected");
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: `finalize()` is deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 18+.

|-------------|----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `final`     | Modifier | Prevents changes                 | Compile-time                   | `final int x = 10;`           |
| `finally`   | Block    | Cleanup after try/catch          | Always, after try/catch block  | `finally { close(); }`        |
| `finalize()`| Method   | Cleanup before GC (deprecated)   | Before object destruction      | `protected void finalize()`   |

# üîí Encapsulation vs üîç Abstraction in Java

Both **Encapsulation** and **Abstraction** are core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.

---

## üß© What is Abstraction?

**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the functionality.

### Key Points:
- Focuses on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.
- Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces** in Java.
- Helps reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary implementation.

### Example:
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

## üîê What is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** is the technique of wrapping data (variables) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components.

### Key Points:
- Focuses on **how** data is protected.
- Achieved using **private fields** and **public getters/setters**.
- Improves security and modularity.

### Example:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String newName) {
        if (newName != null) {
            name = newName;
        }
    }
}
```

## üîÑ Comparison Table

| Feature              | Encapsulation                              | Abstraction                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Wrapping data and methods together          | Hiding implementation and showing interface  |
| **Focus**             | Data hiding and protection                  | Functionality hiding                         |
| **Access Modifiers**  | Uses `private`, `public`, etc.              | Uses `abstract` classes or `interface`       |
| **Goal**              | Protect object integrity                    | Simplify interface, reduce complexity        |
| **How Achieved**      | Getters and setters                         | Abstract classes & interfaces                |
| **Use Case**          | When controlling access is needed           | When designing a system interface            |

## üß† Summary

- **Encapsulation** is about *protecting* data.
- **Abstraction** is about *hiding* details.
- Both aim to make software more secure, modular, and maintainable.
