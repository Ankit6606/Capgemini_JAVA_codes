# JAVA Mini-Project Assignment: Ride

# Booking System

## üìù Problem Statement:

You are tasked to develop a **Ride Booking Management System** using Java. You must apply **object-oriented principles** such as **abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, annotations, reflection, file handling, and streams**. Follow the detailed class and method guidelines below.

## 1. `User` Class

Create an **abstract class** named `User`. This class should have two protected fields: `id` (`String`) and `name` (`String`).  
You must define a **constructor** `User(String id, String name)` that initializes these fields.  
Also, declare an **abstract method** named `showProfile()` which should not accept any parameters and should have a `void` return type.

## 2. `Customer` Class

Create a class named `Customer` that **extends** `User`.  
Implement a **constructor** `Customer(String id, String name)` that calls the superclass constructor.  
Override the `showProfile()` method to print a message displaying the customer's name.

## 3. `Driver` Class

Create a class named `Driver` that **extends** `User`.  
Introduce a private field `available` of type `boolean`, initialized to `true`.  
Implement a **constructor** `Driver(String id, String name)` to initialize `id`, `name`, and set `available` to `true`.  
Create a **method** `isAvailable()` that returns a `boolean` indicating driver availability.

Create another **method** `setAvailable(boolean available)` to update the driver's availability status.  
Override the `showProfile()` method to display the driver‚Äôs name along with their availability.

## 4. `Ride` Class

Create a class called `Ride` that should have three private fields: a `Customer` object, a `Driver` object, and a `status` (`String`).  
Implement a **constructor** `Ride(Customer customer, Driver driver)` that sets the `customer`, `driver`, and initializes the `status` as `"Booked"`.  
Create a **method** `completeRide()` which should set the `status` to `"Completed"` and make the driver available again.  
Create a **method** `String getStatus()` that returns the current ride status.  
Also, implement a **method** `String rideDetails()` which should return a formatted string showing `customer` name, `driver` name, and current `status`.

## 5. `InvalidRideException` Class

Create a **custom exception class** `InvalidRideException` that **extends `RuntimeException`**.  
Implement a **constructor** `InvalidRideException(String message)` which simply calls the superclass constructor with the given message.

## 6. `SecurityCheck` Annotation

Define a **custom annotation** `SecurityCheck`.  
It must have `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` and `@Target(ElementType.TYPE)`.  
Inside the annotation, define a field `String role()` which will specify the security role required.

## 7. `Admin` Class

Create a class `Admin` that **extends** `User` and is annotated with `@SecurityCheck(role = "Admin")`.

Implement a **constructor** `Admin(String id, String name)` to initialize the admin's `id` and `name` using the superclass.  
Override the `showProfile()` method to display the admin‚Äôs name and role.  
Implement a **method** `removeDriver(List<Driver> drivers, String driverId)` which removes a `driver` from the list based on `ID`.  
Inside this method, you must use **reflection** to check if the `Admin` class has the `SecurityCheck` annotation and whether the `role` matches `"Admin"`.  
Use an **`Iterator`** to safely remove the driver while iterating the list.

## 8. `RideBookingSystem` Class

Create a class named `RideBookingSystem` which will maintain three lists: `List<Customer> customers`, `List<Driver> drivers`, and `List<Ride> rides`.  
Provide the following methods:

- `void registerCustomer(Customer customer)`: Adds a `customer` to the `customers` list.  
- `void registerDriver(Driver driver)`: Adds a `driver` to the `drivers` list.  
- `Ride bookRide(Customer customer)`: Finds an available `driver` using **Stream API with `filter()`**, books the ride by setting driver as unavailable, and adds the `ride` to the `rides` list. If no driver is available, throw `InvalidRideException`.  
- `void saveRides()`: Saves the ride details into a file called `"rides.txt"` (one line per ride).  
- `void loadDriversFromFile()`: Loads `drivers` from an external file, reads `id` and `name`, and registers them.  
- `void saveDriversToFile()`: Saves the registered `drivers` into a file.  
- `void showAllDrivers()`: Displays all `drivers` by calling each driver's `showProfile()` method.  
- Provide **getter and setter** methods for the `customers` list as needed.

All file operations should use **`BufferedReader`** and **`BufferedWriter`** inside try-with-resources blocks.

## 9. `Main` Class

Create the `Main` class containing the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.  
Inside `main`, create an instance of `RideBookingSystem` and immediately call `loadDriversFromFile()` to load existing `drivers`.  
Display a menu with options:

- Register a Customer  
- Register a Driver  
- Book a Ride  
- Show All Drivers  
- Save Data and Exit  

Based on user input, call appropriate methods.  
When booking a ride, accept `customer ID` input, search for the `customer` in the list using **Stream API and `filter()`**, and then proceed.  
If an invalid `customer ID` is entered, display an appropriate message.  
Before exiting, save all `rides` and `drivers` to their respective files.  
Use **try-catch blocks** wherever necessary, especially when catching `InvalidRideException`.
